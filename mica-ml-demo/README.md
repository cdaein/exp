### Machine learning
*“field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” - Arthur Samuel, 1959*

from http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/glossary.html:  
In Knowledge Discovery, machine learning is most commonly used to mean the application of induction algorithms, which is one step in the knowledge discovery process. This is similar to the definition of empirical learning or inductive learning in Readings in Machine Learning by Shavlik and Dietterich. Note that in their definition, training examples are "externally supplied," whereas here they are assumed to be supplied by a previous stage of the knowledge discovery process. Machine Learning is the field of scientific study that concentrates on induction algorithms and on other algorithms that can be said to "learn."
