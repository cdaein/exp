                There are 2 courses - first, T+M was offered in 2015. And this Summer, there was another workshop with the same topic called DesignTech. Both were taught in Seoul, Korea. I was not part of the DesignTech Workshop, but Jiwon sent me some information, which I included in this presentation.

            <h3>
              Explore what Korean typography could be in the digital age, where <span class="fragment highlight-blue">screen, online communication, animation and interaction</span> are considered common-sense.
            </h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                This was our motivation. The emphasis is on “screen-based online communication where animation and interactions are pretty much given.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Screen is a very energetic medium. Online data keeps getting updated, animation is great for providing context and with interactivity, we can adapt/respond to changing conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most of the contents we consume is through screen. We thought of exploring the communication method for the digital media.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                So, we decided, to be able to explore the digital media, it was necessary for students to learn to code, instead of relying on any existing tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do use computer softwares to design, but when we directly work with the code, it provides interesting possibilities.

            <h3>Working with systems and rules that create letterforms.</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Working with code means working with rules and systems that create letterforms, instead of working directly with the forms. We have to tell the machine how to do things.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, type design requires a manual adjustment of each letterform, so computer programming is not the answer for every situation.

            <h3>Working with variables and their range.</h3>
            <video data-autoplay loop muted controls controls>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                And we also work with the variables, and they have a range - minimum and maximum values. And that range is on the continuum. We don't have to break them into a few weights or shapes. We set variables for the things we want to control, and set the min/max values. If we push too hard, the forms will no longer be readable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this example, there are about 10 different variables with sliders. And the combination it can make is almost endless. Of course, not all the combinations will look good.

            <h3>Mapping data to letterform</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>distance</li>
              <li>temperature</li>
              <li>time of the day</li>
              <li>nuance</li>
              <li>emotion</li>
              <li>and more...</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                These variables can create a relationship between inputs and outputs. We can map the data to letterform.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some data that are already presented as numeric form, such as distance, temperature or time of the day, etc. 
              </p>
              <p>
                There are other types of data that are more subjective such as nuances and emotions. And they will have to be convertred to numbers that machine can understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                The variables can change. Instead of having fixed values or forms, they can respond to different conditions and conveying different nuances.

                This is from my co-researcher, Jiwon's thesis. He categorized the sounds by its strength and gave different points to each. So when there is a word, we can calculate the word score by getting the total score of all the letters and dividing it by number of letters.

                We can find a similar experiment here done by a German psychologist. Participants were given two words, Maluma and Takete, and asked to link to one of the two forms. Which shape do you think is for the Maluma? I think most of us will connect Maluma with the first figure.

                Hangul is interesting because there is a single person who designed it. We had a spoken language, but no written language so Koreans had to borrow Chinese characters. Korean and Chinese are very different, so it was not the ideal situation, and only the priviledged knew how to write. King Sejong wanted to make Hangul available for everyone.

              <p>
                Here, we see two simple commands for the turtle to perform. And we can give this series of instruction a name; SQUARE. So, anytime we call SQUARE "function", it will perform the same instructions.

                And because the same forward/right commands are repeated, we can tell it to repeat it 4 times.

                Now, instead of telling the turtle to draw the same square every time, we can abstract the distnce it moves and make it into a variable, SIZE. Then, we can call the SQUARE function with different numbers to draw squares in different sizes.

               1. Instead of saying 'draw a BIG square,' we  parameterize the SIZE to respond to different conditons.

              <p>
                2. The way we command the turtle, different actions it can take is a function. We also abstract the function SQUARE.

              <p>
                3. Each instruction is simple; move or turn. We can break down the complex instruction into smaller pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. We can develop the logic and test and repeat to improve it. That is an iteration.

                Our objectives were first,
                1. teaching the fundamentals of programming because almost everybody in class didn't have any prior experience with coding. So we had to start from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Second, we wanted the students to get used to the systematic way of thinking and working, which is required to work with programming and creating a system.
              </p>
              <p>
                And lastly, we wanted them to learn by doing. Instead of just doing simple exercises, we asked students to create individual interactive projects by the end of the semester.

             <p>
               We also created a course website with many examples. It was important that students have resources outside the course for self-learning.

                Conditional design describes the process, "how" to draw, not the final outcome. And because a word can be interpreted differently, the end result is not always the same.

                Then, we set out to understand the coordinate system and draw shapes where we want.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is an interesting and difficult process because everything must be expressed with numbers. It gives us a chance to realize how everything visual is translated to numbers and vice versa.

            <h3>Must have intentions</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                When students first start to draw with code, it is so easy and fun to rely on random values to create unexpected things. That is a great experiment on its own, but we asked students to work with the intentions in what they create because type should be used to communicate something.
              </p>              
              <p>
                So, it is a matter of control vs. chaos. We create variables and control them, whether that's a value or a range or a change over time.
              </p>

                'tti-yong' describes the sound of a spring in Korean. It's like 'boing' in English. It translates the sound to form, movements and interaction. To achieve simple movements like that, the student had to learn how a bezier curve works and a little bit of physics for realistic movements.

                The student created a modular input system for Hangul, only using arcs. Animation reveals how all the components are combined, and it is possible to vary the weight, opacity to create a family type.

                This work is based on student's personal experience. We Koreans have to use two language settings on our keyboard, so often times we make mistakes of forgetting to change the settings and typing with English characters.

              <p>
                The student created a similar design for both languages using simple geometric forms, and also the smooth transition of animation make them work together well in the system.

                The message here is "It's all for you," which is often said by older generations. This is a cynical take on the advice from them. The phrase starts to deform and become unreadable. As we see the progression through animation and interaction, it gives us a better context.

                The student thought about a different way to use emoticons. Koreans use a lot of emoticons when chatting online. All the shapes used here are from Korean Hangul characters.

                After we taught T+M, we thought about improving it a little bit, and offered DesignTech Workshop just this Summer. It was taught by Jiwon and Daegwon, who is a professional software engineer. I will talk about the course on behalf of them.

            <ul>
              <li>Fundamentals of programming</li>
              <li>Systematic way of thinking and working</li>
              <li>Type that responds to conditions</li>
              <li>Practical applications</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                We mostly had the same objectives. There are not many designers who already has the foundations in programming. So every time we teach, we have to start from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                Same systematic thinking and working, and creating type that responds to conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We had one added goal, which is to make the projects usable in a real situation. We wanted the end result to be practical applications.

                We moved from using Processing to P5.js. It is very similar to Processing. As a javascript library, it works directly on the browser and mobile devices without any extra setup, which could mean we can reach a wider audience.

            <h3>Programming fundamentals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>function &mdash; type design</li>
              <li>coordinates &mdash; type setting</li>
              <li>variable, loop, conditional &mdash; animation, interaction</li>
              <li>automata &mdash; Hangul character input</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Instead of going over every detail about programming like a textbook, we tried to relate as much as possible to typography.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was about setting the right context such as functions are used to design type, coordinates to set type, variable/loop/conditional are used to create animation and interaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Automata was used to enable Hangul input from users. Because of Hangul's unique combination system, it is technically more difficult to display text. We used an open-source automata algorithm for that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I want to show you two student work examples. Because the workshop has just finished in Korea, we are still collecting the student projects.

            <h3>Things We Learned</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Designer's perspective</li>
              <li>Team teaching</li>
              <li>Design process</li>
              <li>Communication</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                By teaching two courses, here are a few things we learned along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. First, we learned that it was important to teach and approach from a designer's perspective. Making the difficult process of learning code a little more friendly and using the relevant examples for the designers.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Team teaching was also quite effective. For T+M, Jiwon was more traditionally trained designer and I was more interested in animation and technology. So, we could balance our opinions and provide different perspectives to students. And for DesignTech workshop, Daegwon is a software engineer, so he was able to provide a better technical assistance.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. It also gave us a chance to think about our design process. Moving the focus from making individual outcomes to designing a system. There are also many design concepts that programmers use such as modularization and iteration that also help the design process.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. We also had a chance to think about communication between machine and designer as well as communication between this type of work and the audience.
              </p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Programming is hard...</li>
              <li>One semester is not long enough.</li>
              <li>Loss of interest; no further opportunity</li>
              <li>Nobody to ask questions.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                We also had many challenges that we do not have all the answers yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Programming is really hard. Just the thought of the numbers and mathematics was enough to make students overwhelmed and be afraid even before they try it themlselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. One semester was not long enough to cover both typography and coding, especially because we had to start from scratch in teaching coding. Students were left under a lot of pressure and it was hard to plan ahead when they were not sure if they could make it or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. After finishing the semester, I (unofficially) tracked the students from the class to see if they continued to work in the area, and found only a very few were still working with the code. When there is no connection to other courses in the curriculum, it is difficult to keep the interests. Students usually have very tight deadlines, and this way of working, which requires a lot of planning, abstraction and debugging, is not very attractive.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. I always say to students that Google is your best friend. But, when they are first starting, even knowing how to ask the right questions can be difficult. And when I look around, not a lot of graphic design program has a full-time faculty member who is knowledgible in this intersection, so students do not have a resource they can use in school.

            <p>All artists and designers in the 21st century should have experience programming their own software… If the person is unable to shape the tool they are shaped and moulded by another person’s idea of what the software is and what software can be.” <br>

              <p>
                Casey Reas, the founder of Processing and UCLA professor, said this. If a computer is a tool that we use to design, we will need to understand the tool better.

                There are also designers who make tools for designers. Jurg Lehni created an Illustrator scripting plugin called Scriptographer, but every time Adobe makes updates to the software, they changed how the scripting worked, and he said he couldn't follow up with it. So, now, he is working on paper.js, a javascript library, which is basically mini Illustrator that works on the web.

              <p>
                Netflix has lots and lots of movie thumbnails to create for every movie they have in the collection. And they developed an algorithm where the machine can understand the main figure in an image, not just a human figure, but anything that it thinks is the main object. And it can crop the image in multiple formats without cutting the main figure. It can also place the text not covering the main figure.
              </p>
              <p>If the real designers were to do this, what does it mean to cut thousands of photos one by one and place the text in the right place? How long is it going to take?</p>

                In this example, Erik Bernhardsson, a software engineer, collected 50,000 fonts online using a script. Then, he trained the machine with those 50k fonts.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the left image, he showed the machine all the characters of a font except one, and made it guess by looking at all the other characters. The actual character from a font is on the left, and the one the machine guessed is on the right. whether the machine correctly guessed or not may not be very important, but looking at these shapes may give us new ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the right image, He gave four As on each corner, and have the machine interpolate the inbetweens.
              </p>
              <p>
                We could imagine that the machine can be useful in designing a typeface, or at least we can ask it to visualize some possibilities.

            <h3>Intelligence Amplification</h3>
            <p>
              The distinction between AI and IA is as simple as it is significant. AI makes machines autonomous and detached from humans; IA, in on the other hand, puts humans in control and leverages computing power to amplify our capabilities.<br>

                Machines may not replace the designers entirely in the near future . We have a vision, sensibility and intuition which machines do not have yet.
